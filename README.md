# ZitherTunerMicrocontroller
My third year university project was to design and create an automatic zither (stringed instrument) tuner. The PCB microcontroller picks up the frequency of the string using a zero-cross detection algorithm whenever the string is plucked, and tightens or slackens the tension in the string to change the frequency to 46.25Hz, known in musical notation as F#1/Gb1. A stepper motor was used to change the tension of the string.

- I designed and fabricated the PCB board that hosted the microcontroller and the drive board for the stepper motor
- I designed the Zither instrument and how the tuner would attach to it.
